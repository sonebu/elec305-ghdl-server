GHDL server for ELEC 305 HWs on VHDL
====================================
Live:     https://ghdl.buraksoner.com
Tutorial: https://ghdl.buraksoner.com/static/elec305_hw_tutorial.webm

The test credentials at usercreds.jsonl are not live on the server, please do not abuse them
Contact me (sonebu) if you want to test this, and I'll provide you credentials. 

Notes:
- HTML + FastAPI server that runs GHDL on the (back-)backend for auto-checking VHDL exercises
- VHDL syntax highlighting via https://github.com/WebReflection/highlighted-code
- Last submission saved via client-side localStorage in JS via a listener on DOMContentLoaded
- Syntax checks as well as functionality checks against testbenches for each question
- Check your submission states at https://ghdl.buraksoner.com/checksubmissions
- Not the most efficient web app + interface, but it's simple:
	 --> every question of every homework is a separate HTML page (templates/)
	 --> every question of every homework has a VHDL testbench for auto-checks (testbenches/)
	 --> single python file serves the whole app (server.py)
	 --> username-password needs to be submitted for every button action
